General Instructions for the Game
Each game has its own set of instructions that are displayed before the game begins. Players can refer to these instructions if they need help understanding the rules of the game.

Rounds
Round 1: 15 Puzzle
15 Puzzle: In this classic sliding puzzle game, you have to slide the tiles around to put them in numerical order from 1 to 15. Sounds easy enough, right? But as you slide the tiles, you'll quickly find that it's harder than it looks. With each move, you'll have to carefully consider the placement of each tile to make sure you don't get stuck.

Round 2: Magic Match Card
 In this memory game, you'll be shown a grid of cards with various symbols on them. Your goal is to flip over pairs of cards to find the matching symbols. But be careful - the cards will be shuffled after each turn, so you'll need to remember where you saw each symbol in order to make matches and score points.

Round 3: Tower of Hanoi
 In this classic puzzle game, you'll be given a stack of disks of different sizes and three pegs. Your goal is to move the entire stack to another peg, obeying the following simple rules: only one disk can be moved at a time, and no disk can be placed on top of a smaller disk. As you progress through the levels, the number of disks will increase, making the game more challenging.

Round 4 : Tenzies
 This simple but addictive game involves rolling a set of dice until all the dice show the same number. Each turn, you can choose which dice to keep and which to roll again, trying to get all of them to match. The game is over when all the dice show the same number.

Round 5 : Find the Difference between Images
 In this game, you'll be shown two seemingly identical images and your goal is to find the differences between them. Some differences will be obvious, while others may be more subtle. You'll need to use your powers of observation and attention to detail to find all the differences before time runs out.

Round 6 : Wordle
 In this word-guessing game, you'll be given a five-letter word and have to guess what it is in as few turns as possible. After each guess, the game will tell you which letters are correct and in the right position, which letters are correct but in the wrong position, and which letters are not in the word at all. Your goal is to guess the word in as few turns as possible.

Round 7 : 2048
 In this addictive puzzle game, you'll slide numbered tiles around a grid to combine them and create larger and larger numbers. Your goal is to create a tile with the number 2048 on it - but be careful, because with each move you make, new tiles will appear on the board and you'll quickly run out of space if you're not careful.
